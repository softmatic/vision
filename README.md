### Receipts

Sample receipts from german grocery and hardware stores, restaurants, gas stations and other businesses. Used as test cases for RoboScan receipt scanning app (https://roboscan.app, [Video shows real time receipt detection, recognition and parsing on an iPhone SE II](https://youtu.be/MspQtJGhvzI)) and other OCR projects. Receipts are cropped (subfolder A) and uncropped (B, C, D) 300dpi scans from a flatbed scanner. File names contain the major data points from the receipt (merchant, date of purchase, number of items, total amount due) so that they can also be used as simple ground truth cases for training receipt parsing. The naming scheme is "$MERCHANT_$DATE_$NUMITEMS_$AMOUNT.ext", e.g. "aldi_02032020_19_02423.jpeg".
